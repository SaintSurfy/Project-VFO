  	<h1>What is Christianity?</h1>
  	<h3>So basically God created the heavens and the earth. He created the entire world and gave us free will to choose wether to follow him or our own desires. Unfortunately we chose the latter and allowed sin into our lives and we're all justified to go to hell. All hope's not lost though. God sent his son, Jesus Christ into the world to save us from our dark fate. He was crucified on the cross of calvary and rose 3 days after his death. He suffered and was mocked and beaten just for us. As long as we have faith in him we will be saved from our eternal punishment have eternal life with him in heaven. But our goal is not just to get people into heaven. The main goal of Christianity is to spread God's kingdom here on earth. God sends us the Holy Spirit (Sometimes known as the Holy Ghost) to help us on this mission. Now we need to spread the Good News to as much people as possible and spread God's love around the world</h3>
