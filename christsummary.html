      	  <h1>What is Christianity?</h1>
        </header>
      	<h3>The God of Christianity is known as the LORD (the literal translation is YHWH or Yahweh but the LORD is used instead to keep the divinity of the name and also because we don't exactly know how to pronounce it). He created the entire universe and the earth we live on today and gave us free will to choose wether to follow him or our own desires. Unfortunately we chose the latter and allowed sin into our lives. To sin is when we go against God's will and do things that are not good in the eyes of God and because all of us have sinned and will sin we're all justified to go to hell which is a place devoid of God's glory. All hope's not lost though. God sent his son, Jesus Christ into the world to save us from our dark fate. He was crucified on the cross of calvary and rose 3 days after his death. He suffered and was mocked and beaten just for us. As long as we have faith in Him we can seek a personal relationship with Him, be saved from our eternal punishment have eternal life with Him in heaven. After His resurrection, Jesus rose up into heaven and filled us with the Holy Spirit (who together with the Father and Son is the one true God). Just before he left for heaven, Jesus instructed us to spread the Good News to as much people as possible and spread God's love around the world as we await for His second coming where he will judge the whole world according to their faith.</h3>
